This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android SDK is not properly configured or is missing required components. This can happen even if the Android SDK appears to be installed and configured correctly.  The error message might be vague and not directly point to the root cause.  A common symptom is a build failure that seems unrelated to the app's code, but rather a problem with the underlying environment.
