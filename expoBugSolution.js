This solution focuses on systematically addressing common causes of Android SDK configuration errors in the Expo CLI.  It doesn't guarantee a fix for all cases, as the root issue can vary.  However, it provides comprehensive steps to debug and address the problem.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// ... (This file would contain code to perform various SDK checks, re-installations, path adjustments, etc.  It would be significantly longer and include actual troubleshooting code.)
// Example section for checking environment variables:
const androidHome = process.env.ANDROID_HOME;
if (!androidHome) {
  console.error('ANDROID_HOME environment variable not set!');
  // Instructions to set ANDROID_HOME
}
// ...(similar code for other checks and fixes)
```
The solution would involve detailed code for:
1. Checking and setting `ANDROID_HOME`.
2. Verifying ANDROID_SDK_ROOT is correctly set.
3. Checking JAVA_HOME and associated paths.
4. Checking for necessary SDK components (build tools, platforms).
5. Clearing cache and build directories.
6. Attempting a fresh SDK installation. 
7. Using Android Studio to update and troubleshoot SDK components.
