# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Obscure SDK Configuration Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while building an Android APK using the Expo CLI. The build process fails with a vague error message, making it difficult to pinpoint the underlying issue related to the Android SDK. Even with seemingly correct SDK installation and configuration, the build might still fail.

## Problem Description

The Expo CLI Android build process unexpectedly fails.  The error message usually does not provide clear guidance on how to resolve the issue. The underlying problem seems to stem from the interaction between the Expo CLI and the Android SDK, particularly regarding environmental configuration details.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to build the Android APK using `expo build:android`.
4. Observe the build failure and error message. (The `expoBug.js` file illustrates a minimal Expo app to showcase this problem).

## Solution

The provided solution (`expoBugSolution.js`) involves checking and fixing different aspects of the Android SDK setup.  This might include:
* Reinstalling Android SDK components.
* Fixing PATH variables.
* Correcting environment variables.
* Ensuring Android Studio and related components are updated.
* Clearing existing caches and build artifacts.

The solution demonstrates different techniques used to resolve the vague error messages usually encountered in similar scenarios. 

## Additional Notes

This bug can be particularly challenging because the underlying cause may vary, depending on the specific environment and SDK setup. Each potential solution addresses common failure points, and systematic troubleshooting might be required to isolate and address the root problem.
